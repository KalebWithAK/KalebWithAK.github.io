            <h3>This is a centered paragraph</h3>
            <p class="center">
                We love paragraphs in the middle of the screen. Oh you don't? 
                Why not, goober? Look at me! I look fantastic in the middle of the screen. 
                And if I don't, who cares? That's the whole point of this page lol. Looks like I'm not long enough :(. 
                Lorem ipsum, ipsum lorem and some other latin. Isn't it crazy how latin's a dead language? Like most western laguages:
            </p>

            <ul id="center">
                <li>spanish</li>
                <li>french</li>
                <li>english</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="center">
                are based on the latin language, plus at one point it was probably <em>don't quote me on this - Kaleb</em>
                spoken by the most people. And yet nobody speaks it anymore. absolutely insane to think about.
                I'm kinda just rambling at this point but this is pretty fun. And just in case you forgot, 
                the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. Isn't it crazy how we all forgot the pledge of alliegance?
                Like we said it <strong>180 days out of the year</strong> and now I can't remember how it starts. Also I found it funny how
                america (yes lowercase) is supposed to hae separation of church and state and yet in the thing all k-12 students have to say every
                morning is <em>under god</em>. Anyways, I think this is enough text. Before I go, do your part to stop global warming in any way you can pls and thank you.
                Ok Bye!!! :)
