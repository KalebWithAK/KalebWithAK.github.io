            <section>
                <a class="centerText" href="https://garoaskincare.com" target="_blank"><h3>Garoa Skincare</h3></a>

                <p>
                    A very well designed skincare webpage. The page is separated into different
                    sections. 
                    <br>The first section has a call to action text with a button over a 
                    background image of a woman with clear skin. 
                    <br>The second section talks about
                    how skin requires different treatment depending on the season. I assume that
                    this section's text and images change with the seasons. There is a little bit
                    of misalignment with the other sections with the image of trees on the right side.
                    <br>The third section has a video displaying some of the products.
                    <br>The fourth section has some text about how the fall affects the skin
                    and under that, there are some images of clear skin and face masks 
                    aligned horizontally.
                    <br>The fifth section has a table of all of the natrual ingredients used in
                    Garoa's products. Each entry has the ingredient name, source, and specific name.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Contrast - on this page, the contrast is created by putting each of the
                        sections over a white background so the pop out. In addition to that, 
                        the text color changes from black to white depending on whether or not it's over
                        a dark image or background. There is also contrast between the fonts and sizes of
                        different types of text. There is not much room to improve.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repetition - the sections with background images are the same size. All
                        sections have a border radius. The images aligned horizontally are all the same
                        size and shape. The paragraph text font remains consistent. The fonts for header
                        (h something) tags repeat. The tag line "treat your skin in every season" also keeps
                        consistent font and size after the first time it's used. This could be improved by using
                        more consistency with the font types, although the different fonts seem to be more of a
                        style choice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Alignment - most of the sections only contain a little bit of text so it's centered.
                        Other than the one misaligned image that was mentioned in the description, every 
                        section is aligned. This can be improved by realigning that one image.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Proximity - the sections are already spaced enough to separate the content, making the 
                        page easy to navigate. The anigmations add an extra "dimension" to that space. There 
                        isn't much need to improve here.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <a class="centerText" href="http://arngren.net" target="_blank"><h3>Arngren</h3></a>

                <p>
                    A Norwegian online store's poorly designed website. This webpage seems to sell all different
                    types of products from cars to pool tables. All of the products are just put on the page in a
                    seemingly random way making the page hard to navigate.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Contrast - there isn't much contrast on this page. The font sizes and colors don't seem to signify
                        anything so it just looks like color for color's sake. This could be improved by using color to 
                        emphasize or specify different types of text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Repetition - there is a little bit of repitition with a black border around products.
                        However, it's very inconsistent. There could be more repetition in the sizes and colors
                        for each product div.
                    </li>
                    <li>Alignment - there is no alignment. This could be improved by using a grid layout.</li>
                    <li>
                        Proximity - there is some space between products but one product reaches into what I'm guessing
                        is supposed to be the navigation bar. This could be improved by adding margins between all of the elements
                        and sections.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>
