                        Research Center at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

                        Gala is a clonally propagated apple cultivar with a mild and 
                        sweet flavour. In 2018, it surpassed Red Delicious as the apple 
                        cultivar with the highest production in the United States, 
                        according to the US Apple Association. It was the first time 
                        in over 50 years that any cultivar was produced more than Red 
                        Delicious.

                        The Granny Smith is a tip-bearing apple cultivar which 
                        originated in Australia in 1868. It is named after Maria Ann 
                        Smith, who propagated the cultivar from a chance seedling. The 
                        tree is thought to be a hybrid of Malus sylvestris, the 
                        European wild apple, with the domesticated apple Malus 
                        domestica as the polleniser.

                        The 'Red Delicious' is a clone of apple cultigen, now 
                        comprising more than 50 cultivars, first recognized in 
                        Madison County, Iowa, in 1872. It is one of the fifteen most 
                        popular apple cultivars in the United States. From 1968 to 
                        2018, it was the most produced cultivar in the U.S. Also the
                        worst kind of apple in my opinion.
